# Component Folder Structure

In the **Datawiz React Components Library**, each component is organized into its own dedicated folder. 
This structure groups all relevant files together, making it easier to develop, test, and maintain components over time. 
Below is the recommended folder structure for every component in the library:

```
ComponentName/
├── index.tsx           # Implementation of the component
├── index.less          # Custom styles
├── index.stories.mdx   # Storybook documentation showing the component usage
├── index.test.tsx      # Unit tests
└── types.ts            # Type definitions
```

---

### **index.tsx**
This file contains the component's implementation and acts as its entry point. 
It exports the primary component, ensuring that importing 
the component elsewhere in the project is both straightforward and consistent. 
Any component-specific logic, markup, and hooks should also reside here.

### **index.less**
The `index.less` file handles the styling for the component. 
While most components will rely heavily on Ant Design's existing styles, 
this file is the place to define custom styles when necessary. 
Keep styles modular and focused to avoid unnecessary overrides.

### **index.stories.mdx**
This file provides Storybook documentation for the component. 
It includes examples of how to use the component, details its available props, and demonstrates various use cases. 
This documentation is crucial for ensuring that developers across the team or company can quickly understand 
and integrate the component into their work.

### **index.test.tsx**
Testing is a core part of ensuring component reliability. 
The `index.test.tsx` file contains unit tests for the component, 
validating its functionality and catching edge cases. Using tools like Jest, 
you can ensure that the component behaves as expected in different scenarios.

### **types.ts**
The `types.ts` file defines all TypeScript types and interfaces related to the component. 
For example, it typically includes the interface for the component's props. 
This file ensures that the component is strongly typed, reducing runtime errors and improving development efficiency.

### **Why This Structure?**
This folder structure is designed for modularity and scalability. 
By grouping all component-related files together, 
it becomes easier to manage individual components as the library grows. 
It also reduces confusion for new developers joining the project, 
as every component follows the same predictable format. 
Additionally, having dedicated files for tests, types, and stories encourages best practices like strong typing, 
thorough testing, and comprehensive documentation.
