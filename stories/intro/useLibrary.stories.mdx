It is published as a GitHub Package and can be installed using npm.

## Installing the library

To install the library, follow the steps outlined in the [Installing a package](https://help.github.com/en/packages/using-github-packages-with-your-projects-ecosystem/configuring-npm-for-use-with-github-packages#installing-a-package) guide.

### Steps:
1. Set up your project for using GitHub Packages.
2. Add the library to your project dependencies using the command:
```bash
npm install @datawizio/react-components
```

## Publishing

To publish a new version of the library, follow the steps described in [Publishing a package](https://help.github.com/en/packages/using-github-packages-with-your-projects-ecosystem/configuring-npm-for-use-with-github-packages#publishing-a-package).

For our specific case:

- **OWNER**: `datawizio`

### Steps:

## Example `.npmrc` file

```bash
//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken={TOKEN}
registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com/datawizio
```

Make sure to replace `{TOKEN}` with your GitHub authentication token. This configuration ensures that npm can access the GitHub Packages registry correctly.

> **Tip:** For seamless integration and updates, ensure that your project's versioning follows semantic versioning guidelines. This will make it easier to manage versions and updates within your projects.
